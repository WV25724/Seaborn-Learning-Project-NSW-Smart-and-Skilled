# Seaborn-Learning-Project-NSW-Smart-and-Skilled
This project was created to practice data visualisation with Seaborn using data from the NSW Smart and Skilled program. The focus was on consolidating understanding of seaborn and improving skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and visualisation design.

The tools used for this project were:
  1. Python 3.x
  2. pandas – for data cleaning and preparation
  3. Seaborn – for statistical data visualisation
  4. Matplotlib – for supporting customisations
